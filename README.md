#   Maze Game

##  About the project

Its a 1D Game which was ispired by the maze game prank which was a highly popular game in
the early 2000s it was created in JavaScript

* There is different levels  1-5. Where in every level the difficulty increases,
* The time limit for the game is 45 seconds for each level.
* After level 2 a emney is present which follows the mouse and tries to hit the mouse.
I made the game through inspiration of the online maze game which was popular in the earlier days. @krigjo25 Github to read more

##   Project summary

*   During the project i learned the basic of Scratch, how the different functions works together
*   i also learned the basic of affinity designer.
*   During the project i experienced some challenges with <b>Sensing - Color touches color</b>, function. For some reason the function can not be called for <b> Black color</b> or <b> Red Shades </b>, the work around would be when a specific color is touched, do something.
